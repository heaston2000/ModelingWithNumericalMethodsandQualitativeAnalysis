# Modeling With Numerical Methods and QualitativeAnalysis

The file HW3.mlx contains code for plotting the direction field and trajectories of our Predator-prey equations. It also contains the encoding of the Runge-kutta method we used, and the plots showing its accuracy and order of convergence.

Nonlinear Phaseportrait.m contains code written by my professor Jennifer Crodelle; it is a function that is able to take in a system of derivatives, fixed points and initial conditions and generate a direction field with sample trajectories from those initial conditions. It was used in HW3.mlx to generate the direction field plots of the system.
